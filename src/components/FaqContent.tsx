              PPID is calculated as:<br />

              <u>Why is this important?</u><br />
              PPID better captures the benefit of collecting extra dice while rolling‚Äîsomething that Points per Roll (PPR) does not fully reflect.<br />
              PPR = Total Points / Total Rolls Done.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Take this example:<br />
              We all agree that landing on a 2x dice tile is a win!<br />
              PPR sees it as a <u>negative</u>, since you are ending up with more rolls, which dilutes the score.<br />
              PPID, on the other hand, treats it as a positive‚Äîmore like a refund. You used a dice but got two back.<br />
