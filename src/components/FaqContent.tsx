              PPID is calculated as:<br />

              <u>Why is this important?</u><br />
              PPID better captures the benefit of collecting extra dice while rolling—something that Points per Roll (PPR) does not fully reflect.<br />
              PPR = Total Points / Total Rolls Done.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Take this example:<br />
              We all agree that landing on a 2x dice tile is a win!<br />
              PPR sees it as a <u>negative</u>, since you are ending up with more rolls, which dilutes the score.<br />
              PPID, on the other hand, treats it as a positive—more like a refund. You used a dice but got two back.<br />

              <p>
                Each event rotation focuses on a single resource for the week. You can use that resource to get more dice AND you can roll dice to earn more of that resource. Each rotation also includes a matching artifact as a reward. <br/>
                The event rotations are: <br/>

            </div>
            <p>
              We recommend prioritizing getting all three artifacts first to complete the set bonus. Once that is done, shift focus to only the Chroma Key rotation as they are the best resource and Goldfinger is the best artifact.
